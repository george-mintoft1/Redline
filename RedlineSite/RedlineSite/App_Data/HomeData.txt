<p>Redline Components specialises in supplying parts for Lotus and Caterham Sevens.</p>

<br />

<p>Established in 1989, Redline has a long history of supplying the correct, quality parts to keep these wonderful cars on the road.</p>

<br />

<p>Many parts are held in stock for immediate dispatch, and items that we do not have can usually be sourced. Your items will be carefully packaged and promptly dispatched by post or courier.</p>

<br />

<p>As the only official Lotus Seven parts supplier, we hold a good stock of parts for cars from the early 1960's on.</p>

<br />

<p>Early Caterham Seven parts can also be supplied, mostly from stock.  For the more recent cars, we can source parts at competitive prices, just let us know what you need and we will provide a quote.</p>
